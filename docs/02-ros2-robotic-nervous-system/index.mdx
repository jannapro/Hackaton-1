# ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **[LO-01]**: [Placeholder - Explain ROS 2 computation graph]
2. **[LO-02]**: [Placeholder - Create publisher/subscriber nodes]
3. **[LO-03]**: [Placeholder - Implement services and actions]

## System Architecture

[Placeholder: ROS 2 computation graph architecture]

<!-- Architecture diagram placeholder - to be added during chapter authoring -->

---

## Computation Graph

[Placeholder: Nodes and topics content - 500-800 tokens]

---

## Services and Actions

[Placeholder: Services and actions content - 500-800 tokens]

---

## Practical Implementation

### Code Example: Publisher and Subscriber

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Placeholder: ROS 2 publisher/subscriber example
"""

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

# Placeholder implementation

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    # Placeholder
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
