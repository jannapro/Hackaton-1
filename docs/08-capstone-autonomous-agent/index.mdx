# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Agent

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **[LO-01]**: [Placeholder - Integrate all subsystems]
2. **[LO-02]**: [Placeholder - Define task sequences]
3. **[LO-03]**: [Placeholder - Coordinate subsystem communication]
4. **[LO-04]**: [Placeholder - Debug end-to-end systems]

## Practical Implementation

### Code Example: Autonomous Agent

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Placeholder: Complete autonomous humanoid agent
"""

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

# Placeholder: Integration of all subsystems

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    # Placeholder
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
