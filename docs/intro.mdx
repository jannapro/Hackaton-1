# Physical Humanoid Robots

Welcome to **Physical Humanoid Robots**, an AI-native textbook designed to teach the fundamentals of Physical AI and humanoid robotics through a simulation-first approach.

## What You Will Learn

This textbook covers the complete stack for developing intelligent humanoid robots:

1. **Physical AI Foundations** - Embodied intelligence, perception-planning-action, and simulation-first design
2. **ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System** - Nodes, topics, services, and actions using rclpy
3. **Digital Twins with Gazebo and Unity** - Creating simulation environments for robot development
4. **NVIDIA Isaac and Robot Intelligence** - GPU-accelerated simulation and reinforcement learning
5. **Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Connecting perception, language, and action
6. **Humanoid Locomotion and Manipulation** - Walking, balance, and grasping with Unitree H1
7. **Conversational Robotics** - Natural language interaction with robots
8. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Agent** - Integrating all concepts into a complete system

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes you have:

- Python proficiency (functions, classes, async patterns)
- Basic AI/ML knowledge (neural networks, training concepts)
- Access to a computer with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or simulation alternatives)

No prior ROS or robotics hardware experience is required. All content is designed to work in simulation environments.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

- **Learning Objectives** - Measurable goals for the chapter
- **System Architecture** - Visual overview of components and interfaces
- **Core Concepts** - Technical content optimized for retrieval and grounding
- **Practical Implementation** - Hands-on code examples with rclpy
- **Common Failure Modes** - Debugging guidance and troubleshooting
- **Hardware Requirements** - What you need to run the examples
- **Knowledge Check** - Self-assessment quizzes

## Technical Environment

All code examples use:

| Technology | Version |
|------------|---------|
| ROS 2 | Humble or Iron |
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Simulator | Gazebo Harmonic or Isaac Sim |
| Robot Model | Unitree H1 |

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Physical AI Foundations](/docs/physical-ai-foundations) to understand the core concepts of embodied intelligence and simulation-first design.
