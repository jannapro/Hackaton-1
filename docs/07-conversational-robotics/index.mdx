# Conversational Robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **[LO-01]**: [Placeholder - Integrate ASR with Whisper]
2. **[LO-02]**: [Placeholder - Implement NLU for intent classification]
3. **[LO-03]**: [Placeholder - Build dialogue management]
4. **[LO-04]**: [Placeholder - Add TTS with Piper]

## ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

[Placeholder: Whisper integration content - 500-800 tokens]

---

## NLU (Natural Language Understanding)

[Placeholder: Intent classification content - 500-800 tokens]

---

## Dialogue Management

[Placeholder: Dialogue management content - 500-800 tokens]

## Practical Implementation

### Code Example: ROS 2 Voice Interface

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Placeholder: Voice interface example
"""

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

# Placeholder implementation

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    # Placeholder
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
